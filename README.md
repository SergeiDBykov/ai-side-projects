# Folders in this repository

- [Shapes 3D](https://github.com/SergeiDBykov/ai-side-projects/tree/main/3dshapes_autoencoder) - convolutional autoencoder on the 3d shapes dataset. I plan to add a variational autoencoder for generating new samples.
- [Kitchenware Classification](https://github.com/SergeiDBykov/ai-side-projects/tree/main/kitchenware_classification) - classification of kithenware items.

# My other ML projects
